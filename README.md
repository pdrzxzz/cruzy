   git clone https://github.com/pdrzxzz/Projeto-Cruzy.git
   ```

3. Access the project directory
   ```bash
   cd Projeto-Cruzy
   ```

4. Install all required dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Install Nodemon globally (for development)
   ```bash
   npm install nodemon -g
   ```

6. Request the necessary environment variables (as per the .env.example file) from the project creators.

7. Create a .env file in the root directory and fill it with the received information.
   
8. Run the script.
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   *If it doesn't work, you can try:*
   ```bash

## Code Architecture

### Backend

#### MVC Structure
The project follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture:
- **Models**: Defines data schemas and models using Mongoose for MongoDB
- **Views**: Renders interfaces using Pug templates
- **Controllers**: Contains business logic and data handling

#### Main Components

1. **app.js**: Application entry point
   - Configures middleware, routes, and MongoDB connection
   - Initializes authentication mechanism using Passport.js

2. **models/**
   - **user.js**: Defines the user model and manages authentication
   - **room.js**: Manages game rooms with schema for theme, words, and settings

3. **controllers/**
   - **users.js**: Manages login, registration, and authentication
   - **rooms.js**: Handles creation, deletion, and access to rooms
   - **index.js**: Controls main routes

4. **routes/**
   - Defines and organizes API endpoints and application routes

### Frontend

1. **public/js/**
   - **Game.js**: Main class that manages game logic
   - **createCrossword.js**: Algorithm for creating the crossword puzzle board
   - **displayGame.js**: Renders the game using Fabric.js for interactive canvas

2. **views/**
   - Pug templates organized by functionality
   - Layout system and partials for code reuse

### AI Integration

- **controllers/rooms.js**: Integrates with the OpenAI API to generate crossword puzzles with customized themes
- The system sends specific prompts to the API and processes responses to create games

### Authentication System

- Implemented using Passport.js with local strategy
- Session management via MongoDB for persistence

### Data Flow

1. User authenticates â†’ passport-local validates
2. User creates a room â†’ OpenAI generates words and clues
3. System generates the board â†’ crossword algorithm optimizes layout
4. User plays â†’ interaction via Fabric.js and real-time validation
